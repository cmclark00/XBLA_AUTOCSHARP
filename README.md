# XBLA_AUTOCSHARP
This is a C# version of my XBLA_Automation tool for easily importing your XBLA games into ES-DE.
Setup is failry simple,place the XBLA, XBLA_Unpacked, unRAR.exe, and wxPirs.exe inside your home directory. 
Move all of your XBLA archives into the XBLA folder, and then run the XBLA_AUTOCSHARP.exe program and sit back and relax.
For more info about this project check out the python version (XBLA-Automation) in my github.
